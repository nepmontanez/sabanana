Saba *(Musa balbisiana)* is a banana cultivar which are emerged and indigenous in the Philippines. It is considered as one of the core agricultural products in the country in terms of production and trade. The processed products derived from saba are continues to make a stronghold in both domestic and international markets. Also, it is widely useful in Filipino cuisine/deserts and in fact often used to extend or substitute staple food such as rice and corn [[1]](http://cagayandeoro.da.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SABA-BANANA-PRODUCTION-GUIDE.pdf). 

In a study [[2]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329268613_Effect_of_maturity_on_in_vitro_starch_digestibility_of_Saba_banana_Musa_%27saba%27_Musa_acuminata_x_Musa_balbisiana), mentioned that the Diamond Star Agro-Products Inc., Taguig City, Philippines have a commercial unripe Saba bananas and they will ripen it to 5 different maturity stages for quality classification â€” all green (stage 1), green but turning yellow (stage 2), greenish yellow (stage 3), yellow with green tips (stage 4), and yellow with brown flecks (stage 5) Figure 1). Owing to the lack of quality instruments for an objective measurement of saba banana quality classification have  to be  done by visual inspection, which is time-consuming and costly hence, the purpose of this study.
